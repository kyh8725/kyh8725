          <strong> Dear Hiring Manager:  </strong>
           </p> 
            <p>I’m a recent graduate from a full-time web
            development program at BrainStation where built a strong foundation
            for <strong>HTML5, CSS3, Sass, Javascript, React.js, Node,js, Express.js,
            Restful API, JSON, MySQL, Git</strong> and various fundamental web
            technologies.  After graduation, I have been teaching myself
            <strong> Bootstrap, jQuery, Redux, and React Native</strong> and trying to apply them
            in my website and projects. I also have completed applied software
            development program at BCIT using <strong>Java, C# and C++ </strong> which helped me
            understand the basic computer science, programming basics and OO
            programming concepts. 
            
            <p>I am a detail-oriented, and organized person
            who is<strong> willing to learn and can learn new technologies fast.</strong> With
            proper mentorship and guidance, I’m confident that I’ll become an
            excellent addition to your organization in a short period of time. A
            developer requires a life-long learning, and flexibility to adapt to
            ever-evolving technology, and I have always been learning new things
            and adapting to different environments in my life which I think
            makes me the perfect candidate for the position. </p> 
            <p>I have attached a
            copy of my resume that details my experience along with the links to
            my website and previous projects. I look forward to hearing from you
            or possibly meet you in person. Thank you. 
            <p>Respectfully, </p> 
            <p>Daniel Kim.  </p></p>

            </p>
