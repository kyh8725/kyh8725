          <strong> Dear Hiring Manager:  </strong>
           </p> 
            <p>I completed the Web Development diploma program at BrainStation in 2020. This learning opportunity has enabled me to build a strong foundation
            for <strong>HTML5, CSS3, Sass, Javascript, React.js, Node,js, Express.js,
            Restful API, JSON, MySQL, OAuth, JWT, Git</strong> and various fundamental web
            technologies.  After graduation, I have been teaching myself
            <strong> Bootstrap,  jQuery, Redux, Heroku, AWS, MongoDB and React Native</strong> and successfully applied them to my website and projects. 
            I also have completed applied software
            development program at BCIT using <strong>Java, C# and C++ </strong> which helped me
            understand the basic computer science, programming basics and object-oriented programming concepts. 
            
            <p>I am a detail-oriented, and organized person
            who is<strong> willing to learn and can learn new technologies fast.</strong> With
            proper mentorship and guidance, I’m confident that I’ll become an
            excellent addition to your organization in a short period of time. A
            developer requires a life-long learning, and flexibility to adapt to
            ever-evolving technology. I have always enjoyed learning new things
            and adapting to different environments in my life which I think
            makes me the perfect candidate for the position. </p> 
            <p>I have attached a
            copy of my resume that details my experience along with the links to
            my website and previous projects. If you are looking for an experienced developer at the moment,
            please consider me as a candidate for possible future jr. developer position. I look forward to hearing from you
            or possibly meet you in person. Thank you. 
            <p>Respectfully, </p> 
            <p>Daniel Kim.  </p></p>
